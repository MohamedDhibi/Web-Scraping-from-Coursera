# Coursera Courses Web Scraping based on Demanded Skills

## Overview

This project aims to scrape Coursera courses data related to demanded skills and create a dataset that can be used for analysis or recommendation purposes. The skills are specified by the user, and the script collects information about courses matching those skills from Coursera's course catalog.

## Features

- **Skill-Based Scraping:** Scrapes Coursera courses based on user-specified demanded skills.
- **Data Collection:** Retrieves course details such as title, provider, skills covered, ratings, and enrollment numbers.
- **CSV Export:** Saves the scraped data into a CSV file for further analysis or integration into other applications.
- **Simple to Use:** Easy-to-use script with customizable input for skills and output file location.

3. The script will prompt you for the number of pages to scrape (default is 5 pages). Adjust this based on your needs.

4. After scraping, the script will save the data to `courses.csv` in the project directory.
